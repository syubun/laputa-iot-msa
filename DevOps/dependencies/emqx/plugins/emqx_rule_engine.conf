##====================================================================
## Rule Engine for EMQ X R4.0
##====================================================================

rule_engine.ignore_sys_message = on

## Event Messages
##
## If enabled (on), rule engine publishes the event as an MQTT message
## with topic='$events/<event-name>' on the occurrence of an emqx event.
##
## If disabled, rule engine stops publishing the event messages, but
## the event message can still be processed by the rule SQL. e.g. rule SQL:
##
##   SELECT * FROM "$events/client_connected"
##
## will still work even if 'rule_engine.events.client_connected' is set to 'off'
##
## EMQ Event to event message mapping:
##
##   - client.connected      -> $events/client_connected
##   - client.disconnected   -> $events/client_disconnected
##   - session.subscribed    -> $events/session_subscribed
##   - session.unsubscribed  -> $events/session_unsubscribed
##   - message.delivered     -> $events/message_delivered
##   - message.acked         -> $events/message_acked
##   - message.dropped       -> $events/message_dropped
##
## Config Value Format: Toggle, QoS-Level
##
## Toggle: on/off
##
## QoS-Level: qos0/qos1/qos2
